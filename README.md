##  How I Built This Portfolio

This portfolio was built **from scratch** using:

-  **HTML** to create the structure of the webpage
-  **CSS** to style the components and add responsiveness
-  **Google Fonts** (Poppins) for elegant typography
-  **CSS Animations** (`@keyframes`) for smooth transitions and effects
-  **No frameworks or templates used** â€“ 100% handcrafted code

I started with a simple HTML structure and then layered it with stylish sections like About, Tech Stack, Projects, and Contact. Each project is presented inside a card-style layout using shadows and hover effects.

Animations like **slide-down header** and **fade-in sections** were added to improve the UI experience. The entire layout is responsive and works on desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.
